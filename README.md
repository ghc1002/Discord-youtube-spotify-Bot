A bot I've created to play youtube and spotify audio into a discord voice chat. This requires a second discord user and an open laptop/pc to run it all and open new tabs.
Basically the bot just controls the laptop/pc's opening of tabs and controls spotify.
Then have the pc/laptop set to sterio mix and the output will be played as input of the second discord user which should be logged in on the pc/laptop.
I'm sure there are plenty of other ways to do this that are better but this is the one I've thought of.
